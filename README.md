BBC News Recommendation System

This project is a BBC News Recommendation System that suggests relevant news articles to users using a hybrid approach (Content-Based + Collaborative Filtering). The system is built with Python and leverages machine learning algorithms to provide personalized news recommendations.

Introduction

With the exponential growth of online news articles, users find it difficult to discover relevant news according to their preferences. This system aims to recommend personalized BBC news articles to users by analyzing content and user preferences.

Methodology

The system follows the following steps:

Data Collection: Scrape BBC news articles or use pre-existing datasets.

Data Preprocessing: Clean text, remove stopwords, and tokenize news content.

Feature Extraction: Convert text into numerical features using TF-IDF.

Hybrid Recommendation System: Combine Content-Based Filtering (based on news similarity) and Collaborative Filtering (based on user preferences).

Model Training: Train the system using machine learning algorithms.

Evaluation: Use accuracy, precision, recall, and RMSE for performance evaluation.
